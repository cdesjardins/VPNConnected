VPNConnected is a simple program that puts an icon in your Windows 7 task tray.
When your VPN connection is up then it shows the connected icon, when the VPN
connection is down, then it shows the disconnected icon. The icons are configurable
32x32 icons, or you can use the defaults. 

You simply configure a hostname or ip address of a server inside the VPN network
and the program will ping that server every 10 seconds, and update the icon if 
necessary. The first time the program is run it will show the configuration screen
when you minimize the program it will go to the task tray and you will not see the
configuration screen again until you double click on the task tray icon. You can add
a shortcut to your Startup folder to have it run automatically when your computer
boots up.
